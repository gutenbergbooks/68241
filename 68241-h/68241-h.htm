<h2 class="nobreak">1. My Book is True</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">MY view-point is the painter’s,
the poet’s; ah, I am a romanticist!
But my book is true. The
romanticist finds truth without seeking
it; it is before him, around him, and
he gathers it all with the joy of the
child that plucks the flowers in the
fields. <i>Truth</i> is not knowledge: it belongs
to temperament; it is vision!
The child and the romanticist love the
beautiful, that is all: <i>truth</i> is there!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">2. My Friends the
Trees</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &#160; HAVE loved trees all my life; they
were the friends of my baby years.
Though the land of the trees seemed
far away from the close-built houses, I
wandered thither with great joy and
never knew that my little feet were
tired. The tall aspens were the most
wonderful things in the world: they
are still. I shed tears on being told
that the Cross was made from one of
them. I have wept since at the sight
of their trembling leaves. They trembled
for the tragedy of Golgotha. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
know they will tremble to the end of
the world. Melancholy trees! O but
they are beautiful—beautiful and gentle
like a nun with a prayer quivering upon
her lips, with her white fingers and her
rosary sparkling from under her robe:
and, lo, the aspens are all alike, as she
and her holy sisters must needs be for
the sake of their holiness.</p>

<p>Sensitive to all the changes of the
sky, the aspen reflects wondrous colour;
the leaves, like a million little mirrors,
draw the blue and the purple from
above and drink the orange from departing
suns. And all the colour and
the light blend in subtle harmonies like
the precious pearls on the neck of a
goddess. Ah! do they not pulsate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
like the strings of beads on a maiden’s
breast? The vision is fleeting as it is
beautiful; the colour upon the leaves,
like that in the dews around, is surely
spiritual.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">3. The Profanity of
Paint</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS a painter, out-of-doors, the
aspens are my despair, for they
are surely beyond the limitations of
paint. I once set my palette with
bright colours with a grove of aspens
in front of me: O, but when I looked
up into all the mass of shimmering
leaves, spread out like a garment inwoven
with gems, flowing upon the
breezes and toying with the rich dyes
of heaven, I shut down my box, threw
myself upon the grass and sat there in
idle adoration, like a heathen before his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
god. If all I beheld was meant for a
revelation it was surely as beautiful as
the burning bush. To Moses I am
more than grateful: it is through him
that God’s voice rings out against the
bad artist: <i>Thou shalt not make ... any
likeness of any thing.</i> When God said
the same thing to the Chinese three
thousand years ago they understood
and have painted <i>colour</i> ever since.
Why is the western world in the dark?</p>

<p>O let my eyes be baptized with the
sun that I may behold <i>colour</i> like the
heathen!</p>

<p>How long I stayed in the temple of
the trees I do not know; time did not
count because I was not at work: all
was like a dream. If I had been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
Florentine of the olden days I would
have seen here the robes of a saint,
perhaps the shining garment of the
Blessed Virgin.</p>

<p>I did well to close my box and keep
my eyes unspoiled by the profanity of
paint, leaving the pure impression to
some happy occasion when the memory
of it all will be sufficient for my picture.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">4. The Miserable Pursuit
of Knowledge</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE trend of this book shows
clearly that I am no realist.
Although, in my solitude, years ago,
I made many careful drawings of various
things and gained some knowledge
of their mechanism, my labours brought
me no pleasure save the small satisfaction
of having done a self-inflicted task
after reading miserable books on art.
In those days I pitied myself; but now
I pity the miserable authors. The
education of the painter is a mistake:
educate the <i>man</i>! The painter will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
find himself, sooner or later. If there
is no painter in him his case is hopeless.</p>

<p>Art education, so called, which is the
training of the eye and the hand, gives
one a facility for recording facts: <i>truth</i>
never. Truth is <i>felt</i>. To the painter,
the poet, the romanticist facts are cold
things belonging to the past—dead
things that have nothing to do with
intuition, <i>vision</i>, <i>truth</i>. He must dream
new dreams, employ new methods,
create new things! He is not a
common creature and, therefore, should
not be entrusted with any public responsibility:
but God grant that in all
the economic medley, called civilization,
he may have the right to live.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">5. The Gift of Silence</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap2">ALTHOUGH I write just the
things I feel, my book is an
effort: but I am glad of this. That I
have no liking for any literary task and
hate all correspondence I regard as a
gift. My mother has a rarer gift: she
does not talk. She speaks when she
has something to say and never utters
empty words. O but she is eloquent!
She clothes her thoughts with simple
language and stops at the right moment;
it is a well-timed pause in which her
face counts. Her intermittent silence
is a master stroke; it gives the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
sense of space that I would have in my
picture. Perhaps it is beyond art, but
it is all hers without an effort; arising
out of her good soul it belongs to her
nature.</p>

<p>I see her too little; her home is in a
village on the coast and mine in an
inland city. That I shall miss her one
day is the miserable thought I cannot
get rid of without seeing her. O but
when I arrive my fears vanish in a moment,
for she lives for me. She is dear
to look upon: but when she looks at
me my sense of spiritual security is
greater than can ever be described. I
feel the influence of her peace which
brings mine back to me. Her eyes are
aglow from silent thoughts of me, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
I stay with no other desire than to be
with her and believe in immortality—believe
all her belief!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">6. The Magic of
Words</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is something in the art of
the master that I can never find
a word for. I believe it is a sin to seek
for one. Art in the finer sense is
beyond the limitations of all words
assigned by the philologists. The
master is a magician, therefore it is
only the poets that can speak with
authority about his work: and it requires
all the magic of poetry to deal
with the creation of things. Words
must be arranged so as to lose all their
etymological stiffness before they can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
ever express the things born of inspiration.
Only inasmuch as the poet’s song
transcends the meaning of his words
does he approach the spiritual sense of
art.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">7. The Personal Note</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN talking with brother painters I
often find myself giving prominence
to some particular word like <i>rhythm</i>,
<i>vibration</i>, or <i>colour</i>: but I must always
forget the root-meaning, or I would
discard it at once. I must employ my
adopted word in a new way. Its special
meaning, though never explained, is
communicated by repeating the word
freely in various relations, pronouncing
it with emphasis in an unexpected moment,
or, again, pausing before its
utterance so that the appreciative ear
may anticipate it and catch the spiritual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
sense intuitively and feel all I had
attached to it from myself. It is nonsense
to talk upon art without a personal
note of this kind!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">8. Colour</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">VERY few understand how much
<i>colour</i> means to the colourist, or
why, in the higher sense, like <i>music</i> it
has no plural. Colours are the pigments,
the materials: but <i>colour</i> is the
soul of things!</p>

<p>I believe <i>colour</i> belongs to the fairies;
it never comes quite within our grasp.
It is borne upon the air, its chariot is
the morning dews, and its paths the
sunbeams. I have come to regard
<i>colour</i> as a spiritual thing changing for
ever, as all spiritual things do. Of a
truth it is the beautiful emblem of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
<i>change</i>. The idea of eternal change is
fascinating beyond measure. God never
created a <i>fixture</i> intentionally. We are
immortal only inasmuch as we are
eternally moving with the thought of
God!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">9. Extravagance</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &#160; LOVE the word extravagance in
its application to <i>colour</i>; for is not
the sense of <i>colour</i> an innocent <i>extravagance</i>
of the mind, which saves the
possessor from discontent and death?
I know I shall not die while <i>colour</i>
floods in upon my eyes: it is the silent
music of an eternal vision!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">10. Relation</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE other day at coffee with a
group of young painters I talked
upon the importance of <i>relation</i>. I
went so far as to say that no picture
could have any sense of dignity without
the quality I have named. Everything
in the work should, in some
special degree, contribute to the
first idea. Nothing should be introduced
for the sake of variety. No;
it is better to let <i>sameness</i> be the
principle.</p>

<p>I have seen sheep grazing in a
meadow with all their heads turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
one way, all quietly pursuing the same
course, as though led by a sympathetic
spirit, and I have felt that the peace of
all the pastures was undisturbed by
their presence. I once saw a group of
rustics with all their faces so nearly
alike as to represent a distinct type;
all bent upon the same work, pursuing
the task with natural ease and unconscious
order, and I felt the nobility of
their occupation, the blessedness of
labour. And when I have seen such
people kneel before the crucifix with
their heads bowed towards the east
and have noted from behind the simplicity
in their manners, the <i>sameness</i>
in all their clothes, I have felt the
fervour of their religion, the divinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of poverty that makes them all unconsciously
<i>relative</i>!</p>

<p>But if I want humour I get into a
motor-bus and watch the mixed types,
the short and the long, the fat and the
thin, the hook nose and the snub; and
I get it. But does not the motor-bus
show the painter the confusion of ideas
he must always avoid in his work?</p>

<p>I sometimes think there is humour
in trees when cultivated by people who,
from an insatiate love of variety, plant
one of every kind around their lawns.
No artist, unless he was mad, would
record such a confusion of things as
this.</p>

<p>Of a truth trees can only be painted
by the sympathetic hand, one that can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
make a simple group out of all around
him, selecting only those that, by their
forms, shall contribute to the artistic
sense <i>relation</i>! In a word, the painter
must never aim for likeness; the
material sense should never be transferred
to canvas: more than anything
else trees have superb rhythmic tendencies:
inspired by these, he should
paint a rhythmic picture.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">11. Tragedy</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE sky was impressive by its
change from sunlight to sudden
darkness; and the ethereal fabric hung
like black velvet over all the woods.
All the colour that a moment ago
clothed the trees was gone in an instant,
as a candle is blown out; and the world
was without form.</p>

<p>I stood under a tree. The sense of
my own presence was the only note of
reality that disturbed the dream of pre-world
void.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the heavens opened
high above my head and a stream of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
light slanted down upon an old oak.
Perhaps it was the searchlight of a war
god, for in a moment the oak was
struck, and the earth shook as it fell.
I was captivated as much by the greatness
of the tree as by its fall; it was
torn up with its roots with a mountain
of clay in its grip. But more wondrous
than all were the forewarned sheep that
nestled under it to the last moment.
Why did they all rise and leap forth
into the open field? What made them
flee before the blast?... There are
sanctuaries which should never be unveiled:
there are questions you should
not attempt to answer—this is one.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">12. The Tonic of
Genius</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE never was a colourist
without a keen sense of humour
and never without a generous soul.
When I say humour I do not mean
satire or anything that leaves a bitter
taste. Satire is permissible with the
community, but should never be
directed against a person.</p>

<p>Humour must always be buoyant,
pleasant in every way, and have no
other meaning than that which makes
the person who happens to be the sport
of it laugh with the rest. The one so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
honoured must, of course, be a genuine
humorist, or he would be unworthy
of special attention.</p>

<p>Humour is the tonic of genius. It
is the healthy reaction of prolonged
serious thought, the pleasant negative
of stern reality, the divine intoxicant
for the over-productive brain.</p>

<p>I have always felt that the past should
be either forgotten or turned to humour.
The only serious part of life is the
present, but this should have its lighter
side. When we have ceased to laugh
we have done with all generous feeling,
and, when this is dead, it is the end of
all creative thought.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">13. Critics</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">A BOOK is not worth its paper if
it cannot suffer by the process
of critical mutilation; writing, and also
painting, must be viewed as a whole,
but never pigment by pigment or line
by line. Every paragraph read separately
must call forth some opposite
view or else the book is poor stuff.
Every inch of the picture closely
viewed by itself must bewilder the
observer; otherwise, it is a weak,
insipid, belaboured canvas, good for
nothing. I tell you for your own sake:
<i>do not hold a microscope in front of genius</i>!</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak">14. The Closed Ear</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IF I listened attentively to the things
that others say my work would
lose character. To pay attention to
criticism is to pursue the process of
laboured refinement which reduces all
to the commonplace. Critics with
much knowledge are people with retrospective
minds; they cannot be of use
to the born painter whose work is
creative. Knowledge is related to
things already accomplished; but the
vast unexplored fields open to creative
genius are beyond the range of all
critical analysis. The painter, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
than any other, lives a life of spiritual
change.</p>

<p>Look at the sky! The luminaries
return, return, return! To the scientist
they move with regularity and precision;
but to the romanticist they shed new
light every moment. The astronomer
knows the facts: the poet <i>feels the truth</i>!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">15. The Painter’s
Cigarette</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is a certain something in
a cigarette that gives character
to the painter’s conversation. The cigarette
itself plays an important part in
timing the frequent pauses to suit the
wit of genius. The curls of smoke
punctuate a series of brilliant aphorisms
which otherwise would be impossible.
The painter has the gift of making
parables. The fact is he talks from
feeling rather than reason. He never
makes a speech: he tells you something.
But is he not charming withal?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>He has no self-restraint. The cold,
placid surface, the cultivated evenness
that is counted a valuable asset in the
man of business, in the politician and
the millionaire, is not his, thank God!</p>

<p>In his heart he is a child. He will
talk about himself and his own work
so frankly that you will always be
interested if not wholly charmed. Unselfish
in every vein, his grievance is
never a personal one; it has no bearings
save for his art. From this point
the matter is soon beaten flat under his
hammer of words. If he had not the
courage to say all he felt he would be
no painter! But do not be deceived:
his fearless tongue has a fine counterpart
deep in his heart. As a man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
the right capable of strong denunciation,
he is the man you may safely
approach and trust!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">16. The People’s Café</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &#160; PREFER the café of the people,
and never visit any that has an exclusive
atmosphere unless I am obliged.
I do not care to see many rich people
at one time. It was ordained that the
percentage of rich should always be
small, therefore a crowd of them in
one spot is bad form, often bad colour,
and mostly confusion. A group of
artisans never gives me any unpleasant
thoughts: it is the natural order of
things; the poor were regarded by Our
Lord as the multitude.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">17. The Middle-class</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THAT I belong to the middle-class
is my chief misfortune; it
is better to be born an aristocrat, but
better still an artisan. To the middle-class
belong all the money makers:
builders of monopolies, political wire-pullers,
and all that spells greed. These
people buy everything and sell everybody.
With them lying is an art,
whereas for the poor it is only a pastime.
The aristocrat—the product of
luxury and idleness—is as much above
any mean action as he is at loss in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
managing his own affairs. He must
employ agents: <i>enter the middle-class</i>!
To them he entrusts all his worldly
belongings, with an intuitive knowledge
that he is robbed always and will be as
long as he lives. He knows they pursue
his money with all the zest that he
pursues sport. But he always carries
the same bright face, the same kind
heart; and he would pay to the last
penny. O but how strange, his agents
save him from ruin! and the people on
the land contribute more to the miserable
business than is known to my lord,
more than they themselves ever realise:
and so the middle-class remains the
back-bone of the Empire. But what
does this mean? The truth is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
God made the lord and the labourer:
the rest is mainly the work of the
devil!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">18. The Masterpiece</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">I &#160; ONCE told a young artist to attempt
no masterpiece. The thing cannot
be done. The moment you think of
doing a masterpiece you are befooled.
Providence does not allow you to
arrange anything of that kind. All
you must do is paint with a generous
heart—paint <i>colour</i>—and leave to the
next generation the selection of your
masterpiece. The painter, above all
men, must be himself, without any regard
for the world’s judgment. Do
not be deceived: Time will decide the
masterpiece—<i>Time will destroy it!</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="drop-cap">FROM out the ageless oceans in the west,<br />
<span class="indent3">Where lazily the gods of new worlds rise</span><br />
<span class="indent2">And stretch their mighty limbs across the skies—</span><br />
Insatiate giants roused from out long rest—<br />
Uprose a Titan whose dark arms and breast<br />
<span class="indent2">Blackened the sea and drew the gull’s shrill cries;</span><br />
<span class="indent2">In his dark head he rolled his gloating eyes</span><br />
And kept his cruel lips together pressed.<br />
<br />
The sea that bore him was the eternal pit;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span><br />
<span class="indent2">Into its depths he threw the dreams of men—</span><br />
<span class="indent2">Threw with one stroke ten thousand tomes of rhyme,</span><br />
As many works of art, each once deemed fit<br />
<span class="indent2">To live. One was a masterpiece! Ah, then</span><br />
<span class="indent2">These words came forth: <i>I am the Tomb of Time!</i></span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">19. Mission</h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">WHAT is the painter’s mission?
My dear sir, he has no mission.
He may talk about anything and everything,
but this is his pastime. His art
should not be connected with any movement.
Painting is a personal matter
and, therefore, cannot be regulated by
communities. When the painter talks
he throws light upon himself, which is
necessary sometimes; it may help others
to understand him. The painter must
be judged, in the end, from his own
point of view: it is the only moral
judgment for an honest man!</p>
